In ppd_coin.c:
There was some struggle with this file because it was hard to validate every
token of data that was taken from the coins file and checking the format which was also 
hard and time consuming.

In ppd_stock.c:
In this file, there was a lot of struggle with the check the validation of each token like the id, on_hand
and also the price which was the hardest one because of the many algorithm of checking the
price. Adding the information to the linkedlist in order of the names was also hard at first but after i 
got the hang of it, it was a lot easier.

In ppd_main.c:
Validating the users input for the options was a bit hard in this file. Also using function pointers
was tricky at times. And checking the arguments passed in the command line was a bit hard because
I wasn't familiar with it at first.

In ppd_menu.c:
The hardest bit in this file was initializing the menu names and function pointers.

In ppd_utility.c:
This file was easy to implement but the hardest bit was initializing the system and using malloc.

In ppd_options.c:
This file was the hardest out of the whole assignment files because of the many implementations in it.
the hardest functions to implement were the add item and purchase item. In add item, it was checking the
price inputed because of checking the many possibilities inputed. And in the purchase item, it was giving
the change to the customer.

In the header files:
I didn't change anything in them but I added some of my own define types.
